<p class="story1">A review is still under way at a major Australian stadium where security is being beefed up after two men allegedly smuggled firearms into a packed football match.
More than 82,000 fans were watching an AFL match between traditional rivals Carlton and Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when two men were allegedly caught with guns.
The weapons were discovered after the pair, who were on bail, refused a security request to leave the venue due to their behaviour.
AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon has promised an “end to end” review into the breach and lifetime football bans for the two men.
The incident is not all that surprising to Matryx security consultant Luke Percy-Dove, who said there is a prevalence of weapons in the community.
“If you think about a crowd of 80,000, it probably shouldn’t be that unexpected,” he told AAP.
The situation offering authorities an opportunity to improve security measures following the investigation, says Percy-Dove who believes it will happen again.
“There’s almost an assumption that when we go to major events … there will be members of the community who have weapons on them, and that will be the same everywhere,” he said.
“I don’t see a practical way at the moment of how it can be stopped.”
